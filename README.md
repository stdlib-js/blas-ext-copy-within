    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# copyWithin

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Perform an in-place copy of elements within an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] along an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] dimension.



<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import copyWithin from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/blas-ext-copy-within@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### copyWithin( x, target, start\[, end]\[, options] )

Performs an in-place copy of elements within an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] along an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] dimension.

```javascript
import array from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-array@esm/index.mjs';

// Create an input ndarray:
var x = array( [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 ] );
// returns <ndarray>[ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 ]

// Perform operation:
var y = copyWithin( x, 3, 1, 4 );
// returns <ndarray>[ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ]

var bool = ( x === y );
// returns true
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **x**: input [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor].
-   **target**: target index. May be either an integer or an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] having an integer index or "generic" [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes]. If provided an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor], the value must have a shape which is [broadcast-compatible][@stdlib/ndarray/base/broadcast-shapes] with the complement of the shape defined by `options.dim`. For example, given the input shape `[2, 3, 4]` and `options.dim=0`, an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] target index must have a shape which is [broadcast-compatible][@stdlib/ndarray/base/broadcast-shapes] with the shape `[3, 4]`.
-   **start**: source start index (inclusive). May be either an integer or an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] having an integer index or "generic" [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes] and following the same broadcasting semantics as the `target` argument.
-   **end**: source end index (exclusive) (_optional_). May be either an integer or an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] having an integer index or "generic" [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes] and following the same broadcasting semantics as the `target` argument. By default, the source end index is `N + 1`, where `N` is the number of elements along the dimension specified by `options.dim`.
-   **options**: function options (_optional_).

The function accepts the following options:

-   **dim**: dimension over which to perform operation. If provided a negative integer, the dimension along which to perform the operation is determined by counting backward from the last dimension (where `-1` refers to the last dimension). Default: `-1`.

When a `target`, `start`, and/or `end` index is negative, the respective index is determined relative to the last indexed element, with out-of-bounds indices clamped to index bounds.

```javascript
import array from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-array@esm/index.mjs';

var x = array( [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 ] );

var y = copyWithin( x, 0, -2 );
// returns <ndarray>[ 5.0, 6.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 ]
```

By default, the function performs the operation over elements along the last dimension. To perform the operation over a different dimension, provide a `dim` option.

```javascript
import array from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-array@esm/index.mjs';

var x = array( [ [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ], [ 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 ] ] );

var y = copyWithin( x, 1, 0, {
    'dim': 0
});
// returns <ndarray>[ [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ], [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ] ]
```

## Notes

-   The input [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] is copied **in-place** (i.e., the input [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor] is **mutated**).
